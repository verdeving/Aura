WARNING: Aura is a very early WIP project, shouldn't be used in production code for now!

Aura is a modern game engine built in C++26, designed from the ground up to balance safety, performance, and ergonomics. It provides developers with a robust foundation for building realâ€‘time interactive experiences, while enforcing compileâ€‘time guarantees that reduce runtime errors and improve maintainability.


## FAQ

- Q: Why no RTTI or exceptions even on debug builds?
- A: For RTTI, i really don't like the bloat it adds, i genuinely think it's a bad feature. About exceptions on the other hand, those are decent, but generally game developers don't like how these work and (pretty much falsely) believe these are slow. These are slow, but mostly in the context of the cold path in the control flow of the application (when the exception is actually thrown and catched). Either way, because of this bad fame, i will roll a bi-variant monad similar to Rust's Result or C++23's std::expected.

- Q: Why reinventing the wheel?
- A: If you see almost each header so far, it adds little tweaks here and there that the standard library's features often don't tend to handle, so it's not only reinventing the wheel, it's about making the wheel better in many cases.

- Q: There're yet not game engine features like graphics or physics stuff, despite this project announcing itself as a game engine...?
- A: Let me cook.

- Q: Why no third-party libraries?
- A: The point of this journey for me is to learn about how to do everything on my own without any external help, because i love implementing features on my own, while maintaining the code i produce, production-ready. If i used a third-party library that did this for me, my goal wouldn't make any sense at all!

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Principles

- Safety â†’ Strong compileâ€‘time checks, explicit context management, and zeroâ€‘overhead abstractions to prevent common C++ pitfalls.
- Performance â†’ Deterministic, cacheâ€‘friendly systems optimized for realâ€‘time rendering, physics, and simulation.
- Ergonomics â†’ Clear APIs, onboardingâ€‘friendly documentation, and expressive patterns that make complex systems approachable.


## ðŸ›  Features

- Modern C++26 core with concepts and constexprâ€‘driven design.
- Crossâ€‘platform rendering backend (Vulkan/Direct3D 12/Metal).
- Compileâ€‘time safety framework to catch errors before runtime.


## ðŸš€ Getting Started

For now, Aura only compiles with the latest Windows 11, but builds for Linux and Darwin are planned and on the road!

### Prerequisites

- A 64-bits architecture and system.
- A GPU able to run D3D12, Vulkan and Metal, in their respective systems.
- A C++26â€‘capable compiler (Clang â‰¥ 22, GCC â‰¥ 16).
- CMake â‰¥ 4.1.2
- Latest Ninja.

### Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/verdeving/Aura.git
cd Aura
cmake -G Ninja -S . -B Build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -D AURA_ENABLE_TESTING=On
ninja -C Build
```


### ðŸ“š Documentation

Aura provides doxygen-style comments so that you can generate the documentation with your own design locally on your computer.


### ðŸ“œ License

Aura is licensed under the GPLâ€‘3.0 license. See LICENSE for details.


### ðŸŒŸ Vision

Aura is not just a game engine â€” itâ€™s an experiment in what C++26 can offer when safety, performance, and developer experience are treated as firstâ€‘class citizens. The goal is to empower developers to build ambitious, realâ€‘time worlds without sacrificing clarity or reliability.
