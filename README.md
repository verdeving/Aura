WARNING: Aura is a very early WIP project, shouldn't be used in production code for now!

Aura is a modern game engine built in C++26, designed from the ground up to balance safety, performance, and ergonomics. It provides developers with a robust foundation for building realâ€‘time interactive experiences, while enforcing compileâ€‘time guarantees that reduce runtime errors and improve maintainability.


ðŸŽ¯ Core Principles

- Safety â†’ Strong compileâ€‘time checks, explicit context management, and zeroâ€‘overhead abstractions to prevent common C++ pitfalls.
- Performance â†’ Deterministic, cacheâ€‘friendly systems optimized for realâ€‘time rendering, physics, and simulation.
- Ergonomics â†’ Clear APIs, onboardingâ€‘friendly documentation, and expressive patterns that make complex systems approachable.


ðŸ›  Features

- Modern C++26 core with concepts and constexprâ€‘driven design.
- Crossâ€‘platform rendering backend (Vulkan/Direct3D 12/Metal).
- Compileâ€‘time safety framework to catch errors before runtime.


ðŸš€ Getting Started

For now, Aura only compiles with the latest Windows 11, but builds for Linux and Darwin are planned and on the road!

Prerequisites:

- A 64-bits architecture and system.
- A GPU able to run D3D12, Vulkan and Metal, in their respective systems.
- A C++26â€‘capable compiler (Clang â‰¥ 22, GCC â‰¥ 16).
- CMake â‰¥ 4.1.2
- Latest Ninja.

Build Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/verdeving/Aura.git
cd Aura
cmake -G Ninja -S . -B Build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -D AURA_ENABLE_TESTING=On
ninja -C Build
```


ðŸ“š Documentation

Aura provides doxygen-style comments so that you can generate the documentation with your own design locally on your computer.

ðŸŒŸ Vision

Aura is not just a game engine â€” itâ€™s an experiment in what C++26 can offer when safety, performance, and developer experience are treated as firstâ€‘class citizens. The goal is to empower developers to build ambitious, realâ€‘time worlds without sacrificing clarity or reliability.
